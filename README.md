# FireEdge

The FireEdge is an entry-level cognitive assessment tool designed to
assess and measure critical components of a firefighter's job. 

The purpose of this project is to walk the user through a generic, bare bones
concurrent-criterion validation study. We seek to predict job performance from
scores on the FireEdge assessment. 

To run the file, fork the repository over and run the .Rmd file in R-Studio. An
R version of 4.0.2 was used to build this document. The file should auto-execute
all the analyses and the final report should provide an idea of the obtained
validity coefficients for the study.
